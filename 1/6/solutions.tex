\item[(a)]
Suppose $n = 1$. Clearly, $\varphi(x) = \varphi(x)$. Suppose for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ that $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$. Then:
$$\varphi(x^{n+1}) = \varphi(x^nx) = \varphi(x^n)\varphi(x) = \varphi(x)^n\varphi(x) = \varphi(x)^{n+1}$$
\item[(b)]
Lemma: $\varphi(1) = 1$. Proof: for some $x \in G$:
$$\varphi(x) = \varphi(x)\varphi(1) \rightarrow 1 = \varphi(1)$$
Therefore, by the Lemma,
$$1 = \varphi(1) = \varphi(xx^{-1}) = \varphi(x)\varphi(x^{-1}) \rightarrow \varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(x)^{-1}$$
Let $n = 0$. Then $\varphi(x^0) = \varphi(1) = 1 = \varphi(x)^0$

Let $n < 0$. Then
$$\varphi(x^n) = \varphi((x^{-n})^{-1}) = \varphi(x^{-n})^{-1} = (\varphi(x)^{-n})^{-1} = \varphi(x)^n$$
\end{itemize}
\item[(2)]
Suppose $\varphi$ is an isomorphism. Suppose $|\varphi(x)| = \infty$, and for sake of contradiction that $|x| = n < \infty$. Then $\varphi(x)^n = \varphi(x^n) = \varphi(1) = 1 \rightarrow |\varphi(x)| \leq n$, a contradiction. Thus, $|x| = \infty$. Suppose $|x| = \infty$, and for sake of contradiction that $|\varphi(x)| = n < \infty$. Then $\varphi(1) = 1 = \varphi(x)^n = \varphi(x^n) \rightarrow 1 = x^n \rightarrow |x| \leq n$, a contradiction. Thus $|\varphi(x)| = \infty$. Suppose $|x|$ and $|\varphi(x)|$ are finite. Then we have
$$1 = \varphi(1) = \varphi(x^{|x|}) = \varphi(x)^{|x|}$$
Suppose for some $1 \leq i < |x|$, that $\varphi(x)^i = 1$. Then 
$$1 = \varphi(x)^i = \varphi(x^i) \rightarrow x^i = 1$$
But, this implies that $|x|$ is not the order of $x$, a contradiction. Therefore, no such $i$ exists such that $\varphi(x)^i = 1$, and therefore $|\varphi(x)| = |x|$.

Let $G_n$ be the subset of $G$ containing all elements of $G$ that have order $n$, and let $H_n$ be the subset of $H$ containing all elements of $H$ that have order $n$. Since $\varphi$ is a bijection, and for all $x \in G_n$, $\varphi(x) \in H_n$, then $|G_n| = |H_n|$.

The above result does not hold if $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, but not an isomorphism. Consider the Quaternion group $Q_8$. Consider the cyclic subgroup $q = \left\lbrace i^n | n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\rbrace = \left\lbrace 1, -1, i, -i \right\rbrace$ generated by $i$. Define $\varphi: q \rightarrow Q_8$ such that for all $x \in q$: $\varphi(x) = x$. Clearly, $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, and not an isomorphism. $q$ contains 2 elements of order 4, $i$ and $-i$. But, $Q_8$ contains 6 elements of order 4: $i, -i, j, -j, k, -k$.
\item[(3)]
Suppose $G$ is abelian. Since $\varphi$ is surjective, then for $h_1, h_2 \in H$, there exists some $g_1, g_2 \in G$, $\varphi(g_1) = h_1$ and $\varphi(g_2) = h_2$. Then
$$h_1h_2 = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2) = \varphi(g_1g_2) = \varphi(g_2g_1) = \varphi(g_2)\varphi(g_1) = h_2h_1$$
Thus $H$ is abelian. Now suppose $H$ is abelian. Since $\varphi$ is injective, then for some $g_1, g_2 \in G$ where $g_1 \neq g_2$, then $\varphi(g_1) \neq \varphi(g_2)$. Therefore,
$$\varphi(g_1g_2) = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2) = \varphi(g_2)\varphi(g_1) = \varphi(g_2g_1)$$
Since $\varphi$ is injective, then $g_1g_2 = g_2g_1$, and $G$ is abelian.

If $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, then $\varphi$ must be surjective for $H$ to be abelian if $G$ is abelian. See the cyclic subgroup of the quaternion group in the solution for exercise 2: $\varphi$ from $q$ to $Q_8$ is not surjective, and $q$ is abelian, but $Q_8$ is not abelian.
\item[(4)]
Suppose $\mathbb{R} - \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace$ and $\mathbb{C} - \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace$ are isomorphic. From Exercise 2, for each $n \geq 1$, two isomorphic groups have the same number of elements with order $n$. Note that for $x \in \mathbb{R} - \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace$, if $x = 1$, then $|x| = 1$, and if $x = -1$, then $|x| = 2$. If $|x| > 1$ (where the bars denote the magnitude of $x$), then $|x|^m > 1$ for all $m \geq 1$, so the order of $x$ is infinite. Similarly, if $|x| < 1$, then $|x|^m < 1$ for all $m \geq $, so the order of $x$ is again infinite. However, consider $i \in \mathbb{C} - \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace$. $i$ has order 4, but $\mathbb{R} - \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace$ has no elements of order 4. Therefore, the groups are not isomorphic.
\item[(5)]
Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and $\mathbb{R}$ is not, then there does not exist a bijection between $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$, so therefore they are not isomorphic.
\item[(6)]
Lemma: Suppose $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ is a surjective homomorphism. If $G$ is generated by one element, then $H$ must also be generated by one element. Proof: Let $g$ be the generator of $G$. For any $a \in G$, then $a = g^k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. For any $b \in H$, then for some $c \in G$, $\varphi(c) = b$. Therefore,
$$b = \varphi(c) = \varphi(g^k) = \varphi(g)^k$$
That is, $\varphi(g)$ generates $H$.

Suppose $\varphi$ is a bijection between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$, and that they are isomorphic. Note that 1 generates $\mathbb{Z}$, so therefore by the Lemma some $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ must be a generator. Suppose $\frac{i}{j}$ generates $\mathbb{Q}$. Note that since $\frac{1}{j} \in \mathbb{Q}$, and for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\frac{ki}{j} \neq \frac{1}{j}$ unless $i = 1$. Consider $\frac{1}{a} \in \mathbb{Q}$, where $a > j$. But for any $k \in \mathbb{Z}, \frac{k}{j} \neq \frac{1}{a}$. Therefore, $\frac{1}{j}$ cannot generate $\mathbb{Q}$. Then $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ cannot be isomorphic.
\item[(7)]
There are 2 elements of $D_8$ that have order 4: $r$ and $r^3$. But there are 6 elements of $Q_8$ that have order 4: $i, -i, j, -j, k$, and $-k$. Therefore by Exercise 2, $D_8$ and $Q_8$ are not isomorphic.
\item[(8)]
Note that $|S_n| = n!$, and $|S_m| = m!$. Thus if $n \neq m$, then $|S_n| \neq |S_m|$, so therefore $S_n$ and $S_m$ are not isomorphic.
\item[(9)]
There is at least 1 element of $D_{24}$ that has order 12: $r$. But, there are no elements of $S_4$ that have order 12. In particular, the maximum order of any element of $S_4$ is 4. Thus, $D_{24}$ and $S_4$ are not isomorphic.
\item[(10)]
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]
Choose $a \in \Delta$ and $b \in \Omega$ such that $\theta(a) = b$. Then
$$\varphi(\sigma)(b) = \theta(\sigma(\theta^{-1}(b))) = \theta(\sigma(a)) \in \Omega$$
So, $\varphi$ is well defined
\item[(b)]
Define $\eta: S_\Omega \rightarrow S_\Delta$ to be $\eta(\tau) = \theta^{-1} \circ \tau \circ \theta$. Then
$$\eta(\varphi(\sigma)) = \theta^{-1} \circ \theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1} \circ \theta = \sigma$$
And
$$\varphi(\eta(\tau)) = \theta \circ \theta^{-1} \circ \tau \circ \theta \circ theta^{-1} = \tau$$
Since $\eta$ is a two-sided inverse of $\varphi$, then $\varphi$ is a bijection.
\item[(c)]
$$\varphi(\sigma \circ \tau) = \theta \circ \sigma \circ \tau \circ \theta^{-1} = \theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1} \circ \theta \circ \tau \circ \theta^{-1} = \varphi(\sigma) \circ \varphi(\tau)$$
\end{itemize}
\item[(11)]
Define $\varphi: A \times B \rightarrow B \times A$ to be $\varphi((a, b)) = (b, a)$. Consider $(a, b), (c, d) \in A \times B$. Then
$$\varphi((a, b)(c, d)) = \varphi((ac, bd)) = (bd, ac) = (b, a)(d, c) = \varphi(a, b)\varphi(d, c)$$
So, $\varphi$ is homomorphic. Moreover, $\varphi$ is a bijection, define $\eta: B \times A \rightarrow A \times B$ to be $\eta((b, a)) = (a, b)$. Then $\varphi(\eta(b, a)) = (b, a)$, and $\eta(\varphi(a, b)) = (a, b)$ for $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Therefore, $\varphi$ is an isomorphism, and $A \times B \cong B \times A$. 
\item[(12)]
Define $\varphi: (A \times B) \times C \rightarrow A \times (B \times C)$ to be $\varphi(((a, b), c)) = (a, (b, c))$. Consider $((a, b), c), ((d, e), f) \in (A \times B) \times C$. Then
$$\varphi(((a, b), c)((d, e), f)) = \varphi(((ad, be), cf)) = (ad, (be, cf))$$
$$= (a, (b, c))(d, (e, f)) = \varphi(((a, b), c))\varphi(((d, e), f))$$
So, $\varphi$ is homomorphic. Moreover, $\varphi$ is a bijection, define $\eta: A \times (B \times C) \rightarrow (A \times B) \times C$ to be $\eta((a, (b, c))) = ((a, b), c)$. Then $\varphi(\eta(a, (b, c))) = (a, (b, c))$, and $\eta(\varphi(((a, b), c))) = ((a, b), c)$ for $a \in A$, $b \in B$, $c \in C$. Therefore, $\varphi$ is an isomorphism, and $(A \times B) \times C \cong A \times (B \times C)$.
\item[(13)]
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the image of $\varphi$. Clearly, $\mathcal{H} \subseteq H$. Suppose we have $h_1, h_2 \in H$ such that there exists $g_1, g_2 \in G$ such that $\varphi(g_1) = h_1, \varphi(g_2) = h_2$, ie. $h_1, h_2 \in \mathcal{H}$. Then
$$h_1h_2 = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2) = \varphi(g_1g_2)$$
Ie. $h_1h_2 \in\mathcal{H}$, so therefore $\mathcal{H}$ is closed under the group operation. Furthermore, for some $g_1 \in G$ with image $h_1$, then
$$\varphi(g_1^{-1}) = \varphi(g_1)^{-1} = h_1^{-1}$$
Ie. $h_1^{-1} \in \mathcal{H}$, so therefore $\mathcal{H}$ is closed under inverses. Thus, $\mathcal{H}$ is a subgroup of $H$.

Suppose $\varphi$ is injective. Let $\tau: G \rightarrow \mathcal{H}$ to be defined as: for $g \in G$, then $\tau(g) = \varphi(g)$. Clearly, $\tau$ is bijective and homomorphic, and is therefore an isomorphism. Thus, $G \cong \mathcal{H}$.
\item[(14)]
Let $\mathcal{K}$ be the kernel of $\varphi$. Suppose $k_1, k_2 \in \mathcal{K}$. Then 
$$\varphi(k_1k_2) = \varphi(k_1)\varphi(k_2) = 1$$
Thus, $k_1, k_2 \in \mathcal{K}$, and so $\mathcal{K}$ is closed under the group operation. Furthermore, for $k \in \mathcal{K}$, then
$$\varphi(k^{-1}) = \varphi(k)^{-1} = 1$$
Ie, $k^{-1} \in \mathcal{K}$, and $\mathcal{K}$ is closed under inverses. Thus, $\mathcal{K}$ is a subgroup of $G$.

If $\varphi$ is injective, then there is precisely one element $g \in G$ such that $\varphi(g) = 1$. In particular, $g = 1$ (from the lemma from Exercise 1). Therefore, $\mathcal{K}$ is the identity subgroup.

If $\varphi$ is not injective, then for some distinct $g_1, g_2 \in G$, then $\varphi(g_1) = \varphi(g_2)$. Then
$$1 = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)^{-1} = \varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2^{-1}) = \varphi(g_1g_2^{-1})$$
Since inverses are distinct, then $g_1g_2^{-1} \neq 1$, and $g_1g_2^{-1} \in G$. Therefore, $\mathcal{K}$ is not the identity subgroup of $G$.
\item[(15)]
Let $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. Then
$$\pi((x_1, y_1)(x_2, y_2)) = \pi((x_1x_2, y_1y_2)) = x_1x_2 = \pi((x_1, y_1))\pi((x_2, y_2))$$
Therefore, $\pi$ is a homomorphism.

Let $\Pi$ be the kernel of $\pi$. Note that for all $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, $\pi((x, y)) = 1$ only if $x = 1$. Therefore,
$$\Pi = \left\lbrace (1, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \right\rbrace$$
\item[(16)]
Let $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \in G$. Then
$$\pi_1((a_1, b_1)(a_2, b_2)) = \pi_1((a_1a_2, b_1b_2)) = a_1a_2 = \pi_1((a_1, b_1))\pi_1((a_2, b_2))$$
And
$$\pi_2((a_1, b_1)(a_2, b_2)) = \pi_2((a_1a_2, b_1b_2)) = b_1b_2 = \pi_2((a_1, b_1))\pi_2((a_2, b_2))$$
Thus, $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are homomorphisms.

Let $\Pi_1$ be the kernel of $\pi_1$, and $\Pi_2$ be the kernel of $\pi_2$. Note that for $(a, b) \in G$, $\pi_1((a, b)) = a$ only if $a = 1$, and $\pi_2((a, b)) = b$ only if $b = 1$. Therefore,
$$\Pi_1 = \left\lbrace (1, b) \in G \right\rbrace, \Pi_2 = \left\lbrace (a, 1) \in G \right\rbrace$$
\item[(17)]
Let $\varphi \equiv g \mapsto g^{-1}$

Suppose $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. Then for $a, b \in G$,
$$ab = \varphi((ab)^{-1}) = \varphi(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = \varphi(b^{-1})\varphi(a^{-1}) = ba$$
Thus, $G$ is abelian.

Suppose $G$ is abelian. Then for $a, b \in G$,
$$\varphi(a^{-1})\varphi(b^{-1}) = ab = \varphi((ab)^{-1}) = \varphi(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = \varphi(a^{-1}b^{-1})$$
Thus $\varphi$ is a homomorphism.
\item[(18)]
Let $\varphi \equiv g \mapsto g^2$.

Suppose $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. Then for $a, b \in G$,
$$abab = (ab)^2 = \varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = a^2b^2 = aabb \rightarrow ba = ab$$
Therefore, $G$ is abelian.

Suppose $G$ is abelian. Then for $a, b \in G$,
$$\varphi(a)\varphi(b) = a^2b^2 = (ab)^2 = \varphi(ab)$$
Thus, $\varphi$ is a homomorphism.
\item[(19)]
Let $\varphi \equiv z \mapsto z^k$. Let $z_1, z_2 \in G$. Note that since $G \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, then $G$ is abelian. Then
$$\varphi(z_1z_2) = (z_1z_2)^k = z_1^kz_2^k = \varphi(z_1)\varphi(z_2)$$
Therefore, $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. Define $\eta \equiv z \mapsto z^{1/k}$. Since
$$(z^{1/k})^{nk} = z^{n} = 1$$
Then $\eta$ maps from $G$ to itself. And,
$$\varphi(\eta(z)) = \varphi(z^{1/k}) = z$$
Thus, $\eta$ is a right inverse of $\varphi$, and therefore $\varphi$ is a surjection.

Consider $z = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{k}} = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{k}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{k}\right)$. Then $z^k = e^{2\pi i} = 1$, so $z \in G$. And, $\varphi(z) = z^k = 1$. But $z \neq 1$, so therefore $\varphi$ is not injective.
