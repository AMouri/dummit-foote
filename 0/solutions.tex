Let $f : A \rightarrow B$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] The map $f$ is injective iff $f$ has a left inverse.
\item[(2)] The map $f$ is surjective iff $f$ has a right inverse.
\item[(3)] The map $f$ is a bijection iff $\exists$ $g: B \rightarrow A$ such that $f \circ g$ is the identity map on $B$ and $g \circ f$ is the identity map on $A$.
\item[(4)] If $A$ and $B$ are finite sets with the same number of elements, then $f : A \rightarrow B$ is bijective iff $f$ is injective iff $f$ is surjective.
\end{itemize}
\emph{Proof:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Let $f$ be injective. Then for every $a \in A$, $f(a)$ is unique. Let $\beta = \left\lbrace f(a) \right\rbrace_{a \in A}$. Note that $\beta \subseteq B$. Define $g : B \rightarrow A$ as follows - for every $b \in \beta$ where $b = f(a)$ for some $a \in A$, then let $g(b) = a$. Moreover, for every $c \in B$ where $c \not \in \beta$, then $g(c)$ maps to some arbitrary element of $A$. $g \circ f$ is a mapping $A \rightarrow A$ where for $a \in A$, $(g \circ f)(a) = g(b) = a$. Therefore, $f$ has a left inverse $g$.

Suppose $f$ is not injective. Then for some two elements $a_1, a_2 \in A$, $f(a_1) = f(a_2) = b$. Clearly, $f$ does not have a left inverse - for every function $g : B \rightarrow A$, $g(b)$ can only map either to $a_1$ or $a_2$. Without loss of generality, consider $g(b) = a_1$. Then $(g \circ f)(a_2) = g(b) = a_1 \neq a_2$. Thus, $g \circ f$ is not the identity mapping on $A$.

\item[(2)] Let $f$ be surjective. Then for every $b \in B$, $\exists a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$. That is, the fiber of $f$ over $b$ is nonempty. Define $h : B \rightarrow A$ as follows - for every $b \in B$, consider the fiber $\eta$ of $f$ over $b$. For some $a \in \eta$, then $h(b) = a$. $f \circ h$ is a mapping $B \rightarrow B$ where for $b \in B$, $(f \circ h)(b) = f(a) = b$. Therefore, $f$ has a right inverse $h$.

Suppose $f$ is not surjective. Then there exists some $b \in B$ where the fiber of $f$ over $b$ is empty. It is then clear that $f$ does not have a right inverse - $f \circ h$ cannot be the identity mapping on $B$ because although $b$ may be in the domain of $f \circ h$, $f$ may never output $b$.

\item[(3)] Let $f$ be a bijection. That is, $f$ is both injective and surjective. Then for every $a \in A$, $f(a)$ is unique. Moreover, for every $b \in B$, $\exists a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$. Therefore, defne $g : B \rightarrow A$ as follows - for every $b \in B$ where $b = f(a)$ for some $a \in A$, then let $g(b) = a$. $g \circ f$ is a mapping $A \rightarrow A$ where for $a \in A$, $(g \circ f)(a) = g(b) = a$. So $g \circ f$ is the identity map on $A$. $f \circ g$ is a mapping $B \rightarrow B$ where for $b \in B$, $(f \circ g)(b) = f(a) = b$. So $f \circ g$ is the identity map on $B$.

Suppose $f$ is not a bijection. Then $f$ may not both be injective and surjective. If $f$ not injective, then from (2), $f$ does not have a right inverse, so there cannot exist a $g : B \rightarrow A$ where $f \circ g$ is the identity map on $B$. If $f$ is not surjective, then from (1) $f$ does not have a left inverse, so there cannot exist a $g : B \rightarrow A$ where $g \circ f$ is the identity map on $A$.

\item[(4)] Suppose $f : A \rightarrow B$ is bijective. Then by definition, $f$ is both injective and surjective.

Suppose $f$ is injective. We must show that $f$ is surjective. Let $n$ be the cardinality of $A$. If we index the elements of $A$, then $A = \left\lbrace a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \right\rbrace$. Because $f$ is injective, then $f(a_1) \neq f(a_2) \neq ... \neq f(a_n)$ - that is, $f$ maps precisely to $n$ elements of $B$. But there are $n$ elements of $B$, so the range of $f$ must necessarily be $B$. Therefore, $f$ is surjective.

Suppose $f$ is surjective. We must show that $f$ is injective. For every $b \in B$, the fiber of $f$ over $b$ has a cardinality of at least 1, and moreover each fiber of $f$ is disjoint. Let $\alpha$ be the set containing the elements of all fibers of $f$ over $b$. If there are $n$ elements of $B$, then the cardinality of $\alpha$ must be at least $n$. But there are $n$ elements of $A$, so the cardinality of $\alpha$ must be exactly $n$. In particular, $\alpha = A$. Furthermore, the cardinality of each fiber of $f$ is exactly 1, and since each fiber of $f$ is disjoint, then for any $a_1, a_2 \in \alpha$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ cannot be in the same fiber of $f$. Therefore, $f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$, showing that $f$ is injective.
